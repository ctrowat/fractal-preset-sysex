# Message type 11 78

Size: 3082 bytes

These blocks are large and get repeated 8 times in a preset file

Each one I have observed starts with the same data:

`F0 00 01 74 11 78 00 08` then diverges.  Some are entirely blank ending with just `64 F7`

They must carry the bulk of the preset data, there is much decoding to do here
